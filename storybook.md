## Page 1: Sunny and Sparky the Solar Flare

**Narration:**  
"Sunny, the cheerful Sun, loves to stretch its long, glowing ropesâ€”like giant golden spaghetti in space! One bright morning, Sunny stretched really far, andâ€”Boing! Snap!â€”a dazzling spark burst free! That spark was Sparky, the playful little solar flare, who leaped into space with a gigantic shiny jump!"

**Dialogue:**  
Sunny (laughing): "Wheee! Look at you fly, Sparky!"  
Sparky (spinning): "Catch me if you can, Sunny!"
